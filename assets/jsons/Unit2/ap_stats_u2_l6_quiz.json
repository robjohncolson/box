  "prompt": "A family would like to build a linear regression equation to predict the amount of grain harvested per acre of land on their farm. They subdivide their land into several smaller plots of land for testing and would like to select an explanatory variable they can control. Which of the following is an appropriate explanatory variable that the family could use to create a linear regression equation?",
  "choices": [
    {
      "key": "A",
      "value": "The total amount of rainfall recorded at their farm"
    },
    {
      "key": "B", 
      "value": "The type of crop planted in the plot the previous year"
    },
    {
      "key": "C",
      "value": "The average daily temperature at their farm"

      "value": "The amount of fertilizer applied to each plot of land"
    }
  ],
  "answerKey": "E",
  "reasoning": "The amount of fertilizer is quantitative, could be controlled by the farmers, and could help predict the amount of grain. Unlike rainfall and temperature (which are environmental factors the family cannot control), or the type/variety of crop (which are categorical variables), the amount of fertilizer is a quantitative variable that the family can directly control and manipulate to study its effect on grain yield."

  "prompt": "For a specific species of fish in a pond, a wildlife biologist wants to build a regression equation to predict the weight of a fish based on its length. The biologist collects a random sample of this species of fish and finds that the lengths vary from 0.75 to 1.35 inches. The biologist uses the data from the sample to create a single linear regression model. Would it be appropriate to use this model to predict the weight of a fish of this species that is 3 inches long?",
  "choices": [
    {
      "key": "A",
      "value": "Yes, because 3 inches falls above the maximum value of lengths in the sample."
    },
    {
      "key": "B",
      "value": "Yes, because the regression equation is based on a random sample."
    },
    {
      "key": "C",
      "value": "Yes, because the association between length and weight is positive."
    },
    {
      "key": "D",
      "value": "No, because 3 inches falls above the maximum value of lengths in the sample."
    },
    {
      "key": "E",
      "value": "No, because there may not be any 3-inch fish of this species in the pond."
    }
  ],
  "answerKey": "D",
  "reasoning": "The length 3 inches is beyond the interval of lengths from the sample (0.75 to 1.35 inches). This is extrapolation, and the predicted value would not be reliable. When using regression models, predictions should only be made within the range of the explanatory variable values used to create the model. Extrapolating beyond this range can lead to unreliable and potentially meaningless predictions because we don't know if the linear relationship continues outside the observed data range."

  "answerKey": "D",
  "reasoning": "By substituting 5 for x in the regression equation ŷ = 1.8 - 0.2x, we get: ŷ = 1.8 - 0.2(5) = 1.8 - 1.0 = 0.8. This demonstrates the basic application of a linear regression equation to make predictions by substituting the given value of the explanatory variable (velocity) into the equation to find the predicted value of the response variable (depth)."
