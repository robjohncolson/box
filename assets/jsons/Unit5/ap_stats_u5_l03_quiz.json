    "reasoning": "The mean of a sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the population being sampled, so both simulations will have centers roughly equal to 0.325. The standard deviation for simulation A will be less than the standard deviation for simulation B because the sample size for simulation A (n=100) is larger than the sample size for simulation B (n=50). According to the Central Limit Theorem, the standard error of the sampling distribution is \\(\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\), which decreases as sample size increases."

    "reasoning": "Of the choices given, the best reason for the skew is that the sample size was not sufficiently large. The sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal if the sample size is large enough or if the population is approximately normal. Because this sampling distribution is skewed (showing a right tail), it is likely that neither of those conditions exist. The Central Limit Theorem states that as sample size increases, the sampling distribution approaches normality regardless of the population distribution shape."
