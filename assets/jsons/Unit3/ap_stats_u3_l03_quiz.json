Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nBiologists want to estimate the number of deer living in a certain region. They will use a method known as a hair snare. A hair snare is a length of barbed wire set up near a salt lick, where deer can lick minerals and nutrients from salt deposits. The wire snares hair from the neck of the deer. The hair is collected and sent for analysis.\n\nThe biologists will randomly place 90 salt licks throughout the region. The region consists of 3 areas: the town, the forest, and the lake, as shown in the following diagram.\n\n(a) Two methods have been proposed for choosing where to place the salt licks: a simple random sample or a stratified random sample, with area as strata. Give one reason why the stratified random sample might be the better method for choosing where to place the salt licks.\n\n(b) By using the hair snare method, deer are sampled with replacement. Why is sampling with replacement a problem in this context, and how would the problem impact the estimate of the number of deer living in the region?",

Due to these factors, the deer population could be very different in the three areas of the region.

A simple random sample of location does not ensure adequate representation of the three areas."
