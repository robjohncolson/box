Ask each person in the sample whether they use a training partner, and use the response to create the two groups.\n\n(a) For each method, the researchers will record the change in targeted exercise intensity for each person in the investigation. They will compare the mean change in intensity between those who exercise with a training partner and those who do not.\n\n(i) Describe the population of generalization if method I is used. Explain your answer.\n\n(ii) Describe the population of generalization if method II is used.
