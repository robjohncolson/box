  "prompt": "An observational study found that the amount of sleep an employee gets each night is associated with job performance. The correlation coefficient was found to be \\(r = 0.86\\). A reader of the study concluded that more sleep causes employees to perform better. Why is such a conclusion not correct?",

  ],
  "answerKey": "D",
  "reasoning": "The study was observational; causation can only be determined from an experiment. In observational studies, we can identify associations and correlations between variables, but we cannot establish causal relationships because we do not control or manipulate the variables. Only controlled experiments where treatments are randomly assigned can provide evidence for causation."

From a sample of 50 people who had a cold, the researcher assigned 25 people to take the supplement each day. The other 25 people were asked to drink water each day and were not given the supplement. The researcher recorded the number of days the cold lasted for each person. What are the experimental units of the study?",

  "reasoning": "The experimental units are all the people who participated in the study. Experimental units are the smallest entities to which treatments are applied. In this case, treatments (supplement vs. water) were applied to individual people, so all 50 people who participated in the experiment are the experimental units, regardless of which treatment group they were assigned to."

Online subscribers are people who pay to have access to the electronic version of the magazine. The editors of the magazine want to study how online subscribers feel about the design of the electronic version, and they will gather data from a sample.

Since the research question specifically focuses on how online subscribers feel about the design of the electronic version, the target population consists of online subscribers only. Therefore, a sample of 50 online subscribers would be appropriate for this study, as it represents the population from which the researchers want to draw conclusions."

The principle of statistical inference is that we can only generalize to the population from which our sample was drawn. The sample has three key characteristics: (1) women, (2) students, and (3) at Midwestern colleges in the US. Therefore, the results can only be reasonably generalized to the population that shares all these same characteristics."

Carla's goal is to determine if political party affiliation causes people to be more vocal about political issues. However, a survey is an observational study where no treatments are imposed or randomly assigned. To establish causation, Carla would need to conduct a controlled experiment where political party affiliation could be randomly assigned (which is not practically or ethically possible). Surveys can only identify associations or correlations, not causal relationships."

Which of the following best describes the type of investigation being conducted by the city planner?",

  "reasoning": "No treatments are imposed or assigned to the cars. The number of cars going through the intersection is observed. This is an observational study because the city planner is simply recording and observing the natural behavior of traffic at the intersection without manipulating or controlling any variables. The researcher does not assign treatments to the cars or impose any conditions - they are merely collecting data on what naturally occurs. The key distinguishing factor is that no experimental manipulation or treatment assignment takes place."
