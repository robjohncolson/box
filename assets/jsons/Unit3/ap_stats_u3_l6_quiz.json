    "prompt": "The quality-control manager of a large factory is concerned about the number of defective items produced by workers. Thirty workers at the factory agree to participate in a study of three different incentive plans to help reduce the number of defective items produced. The plans will be randomly assigned to the workers so that 10 workers received each plan. The reduction in the number of defective items produced by each worker will be recorded two weeks after the plans are implemented.\n\nWhich of the following best describes why a completely randomized design is an appropriate design to use in this situation?",
    "choices": [
      { "key": "A", "value": "There is no blocking variable, and incentive plans will be randomly assigned to the workers." },
      { "key": "B", "value": "There is no blocking variable, and the workers were selected at random." },
      { "key": "C", "value": "Each incentive plan is a block, and a completely randomized design is not blocked." },
      { "key": "D", "value": "Each plan will be randomly assigned to 10 pairs of workers who share a similar characteristic." },
      { "key": "E", "value": "The number of workers participating in the study was greater than or equal to 30." }
    ],
    "answerKey": "A",
    "reasoning": "A completely randomized design is appropriate because there is no blocking variable identified in the study, and the treatments (incentive plans) will be randomly assigned to the 30 workers. This random assignment helps control for confounding variables and allows for valid causal inference about the effects of the different incentive plans."

    "prompt": "A market research firm is studying the effects of price and type of packaging on sales of a particular product. Twenty-seven stores with shoppers of similar characteristics will be used in the study. The nine combinations of three price levels and three packaging types are the treatments of interest. Total sales of the product over a seven-week period will be recorded. Which of the following describes the best design to use for the study?",
    "choices": [
      { "key": "A", "value": "A completely randomized design. Randomly assign the nine combinations of price level and packaging type so that three stores use each combination." },

    ],
    "answerKey": "A",
    "reasoning": "Because the stores have similar shoppers, a completely randomized design is appropriate since there's no need for blocking. The study is examining the effects of both price and packaging type, so the treatments are the combinations of these factors (\\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) combinations). The correct design randomly assigns these nine treatment combinations to the stores, with three stores receiving each combination."

    "prompt": "A researcher is studying the effect of genetically modified (GM) and nongenetically modified (nGM) corn on the weight gain of lambs. The sex and genetics of the lambs can affect their weight gain. Five sets of male twin lambs and five sets of female twin lambs—for a total of twenty lambs—are available for the study. The lambs will be randomly assigned to a diet of either GM or nGM diet of corn. Weight gain will be recorded for each lamb after five weeks on the diet. Which of the following designs would be best to use in the study?",

    ],
    "answerKey": "E",
    "reasoning": "A matched pairs design is most appropriate because twin lambs are naturally matched - they share the same sex and have similar genetic factors that affect weight gain. By randomly assigning one twin to each diet treatment within each pair, this design controls for both sex and genetic variation, providing the most precise comparison of the diet effects while minimizing the influence of confounding variables."
