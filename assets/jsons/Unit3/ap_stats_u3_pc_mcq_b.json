To determine whether customers prefer one of the new formulas over the current nacho flavoring, a sample of 50 customers is obtained. Each customer tastes both formula A and formula B in a randomly assigned order and indicates which one they prefer more. Which of the following best describes this study?",

    "reasoning": "Students were allowed to self-select their treatmentâ€”the new menu item. Random assignment of treatments to experimental units, a key component of a well-designed study, is lacking.
