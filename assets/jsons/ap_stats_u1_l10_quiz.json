For the large puzzle, the empirical rule guarantees that approximately 68% of the times will be within 1 standard deviation of the mean of 180 minutes.

What does this indicate about the finishing times of the women who ran the marathon compared to the finishing times of the men who ran the marathon?",
  "reasoning": "Part (a): Clay's finishing time was 289 minutes and the distribution of finishing time for men had a mean of 242 minutes and a standard deviation of 29 minutes. The standardized score for Clay's marathon time is: z = (289-242)/29 ≈ 1.62. Clay's finishing time is 1.62 standard deviations greater than the men's mean finishing time. Part (b): Kathy's finishing time was 272 minutes and the distribution of finishing time for women had a mean of 259 minutes and a standard deviation of 32 minutes. The standardized score for Kathy's marathon time is: z = (272-259)/32 ≈ 0.41. Using technology or the standard normal table, the proportion of women who ran the marathon with a finishing time less than Kathy is approximately 0.66. Part (c): Since the standard deviation for women's times is greater than the standard deviation for men's times, there is more variability in the women's times than in the men's times. This indicates that, on average, women's times are further away from the women's mean marathon time than the average distance men's times are away from the men's mean marathon time."
