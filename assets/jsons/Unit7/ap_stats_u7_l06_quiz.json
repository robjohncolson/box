She selected and analyzed a random sample of 40 different types of Brand A shoes and 33 different types of Brand B shoes. Alicia observes that the boxplot of the sample of Brand A shoe prices shows two outliers. Alicia wants to construct a confidence interval to estimate the difference in population means. Is the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means approximately normal?",
    "choices": [
      { "key": "A", "value": "Yes, because Alicia selected a random sample." },
      { "key": "B", "value": "Yes, because for each brand it is reasonable to assume that the population size is greater than ten times its sample size." },
      { "key": "C", "value": "Yes, because the size of each sample is at least 30." },
      { "key": "D", "value": "No, because the distribution of Brand A shoes has outliers." },

    ],
    "answerKey": "C",
    "reasoning": "Although the boxplot shows outliers, both sample sizes (40 and 33) are greater than 30, so based on the central limit theorem, the distribution of the difference in sample means is approximately normal. The central limit theorem ensures that sampling distributions of means approach normality when sample sizes are large (typically \\(n \\geq 30\\)), regardless of the shape of the population distribution or presence of outliers in the sample data."
