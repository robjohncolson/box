Economists in the region investigated the difference between the salaries of those who work in oil-field jobs and those who work in non-oil-field jobs. Salaries were recorded for a random sample of 84 workers from the 1,200 oil-field workers and a random sample of 72 workers from the 50,000 non-oil-field workers in the region. A 95 percent confidence interval for \\(\\mu_O - \\mu_N\\), where \\(\\mu_O\\) is the mean salary of all jobs of oil-field workers and \\(\\mu_N\\) is the mean salary of all jobs of non-oil-field workers, will be constructed.

    "reasoning": "The conditions for independence have been satisfied. Independent, random samples were collected from each of the two populations (oil-field workers and non-oil-field workers), and each sample size is less than 10 percent of its corresponding population size: \\(84 < 1.10(1,200)\\) and \\(72 < 0.10(50,000)\\). Finally, each sample size is also greater than 30, so the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means can be assumed to be approximately normal."
