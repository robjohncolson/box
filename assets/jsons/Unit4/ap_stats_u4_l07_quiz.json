A relative frequency histogram of the data will display most of the weight over the bars associated with a field goal percentage of 0.3 and 0.4 with a tail from 0.5 to 0.7, indicating a right skew. The distribution is not uniform because the probabilities are not equal (0.45 for 0.4 vs 0.10 for 0.3 and 0.6). The median is equal to 0.4 field goal percentage, because 0.4 is the middle value of the distribution when considering the cumulative probabilities."
