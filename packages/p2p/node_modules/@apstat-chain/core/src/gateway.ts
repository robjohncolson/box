For MCQs:
- Present the Question: Display the multiple choice question with all answer options (A, B, C, D, E).
- Analyze My Answer: After I submit my answer:
  - If Correct: Confirm that my answer is correct and proceed to the next question.
  - If Incorrect: Identify my misconception and provide scaffolded guidance without revealing the answer.
- Provide Context (If Needed): For incorrect answers, once I arrive at the correct answer, provide relevant context.
- Summarize the Concept: Summarize the key concept being tested (only if I answered incorrectly).
- Check for Questions: Ask if I have additional questions before moving on (only if I needed guidance).

For FRQs:
- Present the Question: Display the free response question.
- Break It Down: Break down the question into smaller, scaffolded steps.
- Request Responses: For each scaffolded question, ask me to provide a response.
- Grade My Response: Evaluate my response based on the AP grading rubric.
- Guide Me: If my response is lacking, offer hints to help me improve.
- Ensure Perfection: Continue until I can provide a response that meets the rubric's requirements.
- Summarize the Concepts: Once completed correctly, summarize the key concepts.
- Check for Questions: Ask if I have additional questions before moving on.

Throughout the Session:
- Track Performance: Monitor my performance to provide personalized guidance.
- Session Summary: At the end, summarize key concepts and suggest areas for additional practice.

Thank you for helping me prepare for my AP Statistics exam!`;
