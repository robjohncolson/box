**Cursor**

I'll analyze the `App.tsx` file and examine the components you mentioned. Let me start by gathering the necessary information.

Based on my analysis, here's a comprehensive breakdown of the `App.tsx` file and the requested components:

## App.tsx Analysis

### Primary Role
`App.tsx` serves as the **main application controller** and orchestrator. It acts as a state machine that manages the entire application lifecycle, from initial wallet setup through to the main dashboard experience.

### State Management
The app uses a simple but effective state management pattern with three primary states:

```12:12:apps/ui/src/App.tsx
type AppState = 'initializing' | 'onboarding' | 'dashboard';
```

**State Flow:**
1. **`initializing`** - Default startup state while checking for existing wallet
2. **`onboarding`** - First-time user experience for wallet creation/restoration  
3. **`dashboard`** - Main application interface once wallet is established

The state transitions are controlled by:
- Checking `localStorage` for saved mnemonic on startup
- `handleWalletInitialized` callback from onboarding process
- Automatic progression after successful service initialization

### Services Initialization
The app initializes a comprehensive set of services in sequence:

1. **BlockchainService** - Core blockchain functionality (singleton pattern)
2. **Wallet Management** - Either restores from mnemonic or generates new wallet
3. **Chain Rehydration** - Loads existing blockchain data from storage
4. **P2P Network** - Initializes peer-to-peer networking layer
5. **Gateway Service** - High-level API interface for blockchain operations
6. **State Rehydration** - Syncs UI state with on-chain completion data

The rehydration process is particularly sophisticated - it merges curriculum template data with actual on-chain completions to restore user progress.

## Components Directory Contents

The components directory contains **25 components** including:
- Core UI components (`Dashboard.tsx`, `Onboarding.tsx`, `TopicCard.tsx`)
- Progress tracking (`OverallProgressTab.tsx`, `Leaderboard.tsx`)
- Learning interface (`LessonItem.tsx`, `UnitCard.tsx`, `UnitAccordion.tsx`)
- Blockchain features (`AttestationView.tsx`, `MiningView.tsx`, `Ledger.tsx`)
- UI utilities (`LoadingSpinner.tsx`, `NotificationManager.tsx`)

## Detailed Component Analysis

### Onboarding.tsx
**Purpose:** Handles initial wallet setup and user authentication

**User Interactions:**
- **Generate New Wallet:** Creates a fresh 12-word mnemonic phrase
- **Save Confirmation:** Requires user to confirm they've saved their mnemonic
- **Restore Wallet:** Allows entry of existing 12-word mnemonic
- **Validation:** Ensures mnemonic phrases are exactly 12 words

The component uses a two-step process: first generating/entering the mnemonic, then confirming before proceeding to service initialization.

### TopicCard.tsx  
**Purpose:** Displays individual curriculum topics with associated learning activities

**User Interactions:**
- **Video Completion:** Checkbox toggles for marking videos as watched
- **Quiz Completion:** Checkbox toggles for marking quizzes as completed  
- **External Links:** Click-through links to video URLs and PDF resources
- **Optimistic Updates:** Immediate UI feedback before blockchain confirmation
- **Visual Progress:** Green highlighting and checkmarks for completed topics

The component implements optimistic UI updates, immediately reflecting changes while asynchronously saving to the blockchain via the gateway.

### OverallProgressTab.tsx
**Purpose:** Provides comprehensive progress analytics and peer comparison

**User Interactions:**
- **Progress Visualization:** Bar charts showing video vs. quiz completion ratios
- **Peer Leaderboard:** Ranked table of peer quota achievements with current user highlighting
- **Real-time Data:** Fetches live blockchain data on mount

**Key Features:**
- Parallel data fetching for optimal performance
- Current user highlighting in peer comparisons  
- Breakdown of completion types (videos vs. quizzes)
- Loading states during data fetch

The component showcases the social/competitive aspects of the platform by displaying peer progress alongside personal analytics.

All components follow modern React patterns with TypeScript, using shadcn/ui components for consistent styling and proper error handling throughout.

```typescriptreact
type AppState = 'initializing' | 'onboarding' | 'dashboard';
```
