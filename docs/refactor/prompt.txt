I am trying to create an app within Cursor IDE, and need to refactor.  I've given this prompt to 4 separate LLM's, "You're in a codebase, and I'm about to do a major from-scratch rebuild. At the moment, I want to understand what to delete, what to keep.stores all the architectural documents, if you look through that you will understand the design decisions made for my app, and most of them, are in line with what I will recreate.shows an initial refactoring/rebuilding plan that takes into account the ADRs, and the probes. This app, the most important thing it will do are two things.. serve lesson data. (A). originally in@allUnitsData.js ..but recently converted to @curriculumData.ts . This lesson data is comprised of links to external videos, the most important ones will be deeme d"alt URL" in term sof vidoes.. and links to quizzes which are PDFs housed in . The purpose of these pdf quizzes are to serve as context for the user to attach to a grok llm 's prompt, along with a grok prompt located at @GrokPromptTab.tsx . SO that is 1 thing that this app will do. The other is a multi-user aspect. (B). The progress of the user through the tasks listed above in (A)needs to be kept, and viewed eventually by all peers (B). (B) is comprised of adatabase.. and that database will keep track of.. partial progress of the lessons completed in (A), of which there are 89 lessons. (B) is a blockchain-type-database who uses merkle trees/proofs for determinining syncing status between the peers. Most importantly about (B).. is the mempool feature which will.. aggregate all data before a block is commited. Students are motivated to see their own score on a leaderboard to commit thei rprogress to the block so.. a part of (B)'s functoin is to.. test the knowledge of the students through peer attestation. As soon as there is 1 lesson's worth of progress in the mempool..(each lesson's items have a certain point value @lessons_export.json , students will be permitted to try to mine a block by answering a question.. there are many questions.. and they are all correlated to the lessons in (A). I am unsure where this table of questions lives.. I think it's...@questions_export.json ? Which points to a bunc hof png files each correlated to a lesson. and they live..@/questions . So a student answers this question.. proposes a candidate block so to speak, and fellow peers 3 or.. more.. must verify that the answer is true. once verified, that block is mined, and the leaderboard across all peers needs to be updated.I want to know.. how to consolidate this.. how to rework it.. I don't want you to give me any code, I just want to brainstorm with you."

Attached are their responses.

Help me navigate this, please?  No code, just brainstorm.
