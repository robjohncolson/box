Okay, I've analyzed each of the provided questions and correlated them to the most relevant branch of the AP Statistics knowledge tree I created earlier. Here's the breakdown, with explanations:

1. Population Pyramids Question

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 1.4 Representing a Categorical Variable with Graphs (and 1.5 potentially, as it involves interpreting a graphical representation, even though age is binned, making it appear categorical here.)

Reasoning: This question requires interpreting population pyramids, which are essentially back-to-back histograms (a type of graph). It focuses on understanding the distribution of a single variable (age) within different populations (male/female for two countries). It's about reading and comparing distributions presented graphically.

2. On-Time Airline Arrivals Boxplot

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 1.8 Graphical Representations of Summary Statistics, and by extension 1.7 Summary Statistics for a quantitative variable.

Reasoning: This question directly asks about interpreting a boxplot, a key graphical representation of summary statistics (quartiles, median, range, IQR). It tests understanding of these summary statistics and how they are visually represented.

3. Grain Moisture Dotplots

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 1.9 Comparing Distributions of a Quantitative Variable

Reasoning: This question involves comparing two dotplots, another type of graphical representation for quantitative data. The core task is to compare summary statistics (quartiles, median, range, IQR) between two distributions.

4. Newborn Baby Sleep Time (Normal Distribution)

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 1.10 The Normal Distribution

Reasoning: This question explicitly states that the distribution is normal and asks for a calculation based on percentiles and standard deviation, directly related to the properties of the normal distribution.

5. Sampling Distribution Standard Deviation

Branch: Unit 5: Sampling Distributions

Sub-Branch: 5.7 Sampling Distributions for Sample Means

Reasoning: The question shows a normal curve representing a sampling distribution of a sample mean. It asks for the standard deviation of the population, given the sampling distribution's standard deviation (standard error) and sample size. This is a core concept of sampling distributions.

6. Female Cross-Country Runner Weights (Normal Distribution)

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 1.10 The Normal Distribution

Reasoning: Similar to question 4, this deals with a normally distributed variable (weight) and asks for a percentage within a given range. This requires calculating z-scores or using the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule), both fundamental to working with normal distributions.

7. Nyasha's Financial Literacy Project (Unit Conversion)

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-branch: 1.7, Summary statistic for a quantitative variable.

Reasoning: This question tests understanding of how different summary statistics (median, standard deviation, standardized score, mean, IQR) are affected by a linear transformation (unit conversion). While not directly tied to a single lesson, it draws on the fundamental properties of these statistics, covered in Unit 1. The key is understanding which statistics are resistant to changes in scale and which are not.

8. Egg Carton Weights (Normal Distribution)

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 1.10 The Normal Distribution

Reasoning: This is another normal distribution question. The key here is recognizing that the interval centered on the mean will contain the greatest proportion of the data in a normal distribution.

9. Golf Tournament Scores Boxplots

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 1.9 Comparing Distributions of a Quantitative Variable, and also drawing on 1.8.

Reasoning: This question requires comparing two boxplots, assessing measures of center and spread (range, implicitly quartiles, and median) to draw conclusions about the two distributions.

10. Dog and Cat Ownership Probability

Branch: Unit 4: Probability, Random Variables, and Probability Distributions

Sub-Branch: 4.3 Introduction to Probability, and possibly 4.6 (Independent events and unions).

Reasoning: This is a basic probability question. However, it's a trick question because it doesn't provide enough information to determine the probability of owning either a dog or a cat (we'd need to know the overlap – the percentage owning both). This highlights the importance of understanding the addition rule for probabilities and the concept of mutually exclusive events.

11. Sociologist's Boxplots (Education and Fast Food)

Branch Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable data

Sub-Branch: 1.9 Comparing Distributions of a Quantitative Variable, and also drawing on 1.8.

Reasoning The multiple box plots need to be analyzed based on their summary statistics. The spread and median of the distributions are compared.

Summary Table:

This detailed mapping shows how seemingly simple questions often draw on multiple, interconnected concepts within the AP Statistics curriculum. The ability to connect these concepts is key to success.

Okay, let's continue mapping these questions to the AP Statistics knowledge tree:

12. College Football Rushing Yards (Z-score)

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 1.7 Summary Statistics for a Quantitative Variable (specifically, standard deviation and its relationship to z-scores). Although not explicitly mentioned, the concept relates to 1.10 The Normal Distribution, as z-scores are implicitly linked to a standard normal distribution.

Reasoning: This question provides a z-score (2.42 standard deviations above the mean), a data point (1637 yards), and the mean (790 yards). The task is to calculate the standard deviation using the z-score formula: z = (x - μ) / σ. Rearranging, we get σ = (x - μ) / z.

13. Video Game Playing (Two-Way Table)

Branch: Unit 2: Exploring Two-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 2.2 Representing Two Categorical Variables and 2.3 Statistics for Two Categorical Variables

Reasoning: This question presents data in a two-way table (categorical variables: School and Play Video Games). It asks for a conditional proportion: the proportion of Arts students who play video games. This is a direct application of reading and interpreting two-way tables.

14. Marketing Firm Histograms (Standard Deviation)

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 1.6 Describing the Distribution of a Quantitative Variable and 1.7 (conceptually, understanding standard deviation as a measure of spread).

Reasoning: This question requires visually estimating which histogram has the smallest standard deviation. This relies on understanding that standard deviation reflects the spread or variability of the data. The most compact, least spread-out histogram will have the smallest standard deviation.

15. New Employee Training (Distribution Shape)

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 1.6 Describing the Distribution of a Quantitative Variable

Reasoning: This question asks about the shape of a distribution that would represent the greatest percentage of "well-prepared" employees (scores above the mean). A left-skewed distribution would have a longer tail on the left side and a concentration of scores above the mean.

16. (FRQ Part A) Biology Spreadsheet Histograms

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data
* Sub-Branch: 1.6, Describing the Distribution of a Quantitative Variable, 1.9 Comparing distributions of a quantitative variable
* Reasoning: (a) requires identifying which histogram represents which group (with and without spreadsheet experience) based on their shapes and likely completion times. This is distribution comparison and interpretation.

17. (FRQ Part B) Combined Histogram Shape

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 1.6 Describing the Distribution of a Quantitative Variable

Reasoning: (b) asks for the shape of the combined distribution. Combining a right-skewed distribution and an approximately normal (or less skewed) distribution will generally result in a right-skewed distribution, potentially bimodal.

18. (FRQ Part C) Sampling Distribution

Branch: Unit 5: Sampling Distributions

Sub-Branch: 5.7 Sampling Distributions for Sample Means and 5.3 The Central Limit Theorem

Reasoning: (c) explicitly asks about the sampling distribution of the sample mean. This invokes the Central Limit Theorem: even if the population distribution is skewed, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal for a sufficiently large sample size (n=50 is generally considered large enough).

19. Dotplot Description

22. Car Rental Boxplots

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 1.9 Comparing Distributions of a Quantitative Variable

Reasoning: This requires comparing two boxplots, focusing on differences in variability (spread) and median (center).

23. Corn Weights (Z-score)

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 1.7 Summary Statistics and the related concept of standardization (z-scores).

Reasoning: This question involves comparing z-scores from two different distributions (Iowa and Ohio corn). It requires calculating the z-score for the Ohio corn, given its weight, the mean, and the relationship between the standard deviations of the two distributions.

24. Resting Heart Rates (Outliers)

Branch: Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data

Sub-Branch: 1.7 Summary Statistics (specifically, quartiles and IQR) and the definition of outliers.
